A MATLAB wrapper for solving DenseCRF problems [1,2]. 
The code uses the c++ library provided with [2].

How to use?
---

* For solving a general problem see examples/example.m.

* For segmentation on the MSRC-21 database using the unary potentials from [http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/densecrf/unary/](http://graphics.stanford.edu/projects/densecrf/unary/) see examples/example_MSRC.m

Included solvers
--
* Meanfield [2].
* TRWS-S [3].
* MATLAB implementation of meanfield (very slow).
